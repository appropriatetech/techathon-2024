        <h2>What is Appropriate Technology?</h2>
        <p>“Appropriate Technology” is a movement advocating for an approach to the development and deployment of technology that honors cultural sensitivity, maintains ecological balance and fosters economic sustainability. Technology in this context encompases products beyond digital or computer-based fields. Technology, broadly, is the application of scientific or conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals.</p>

        <h2>What is the INAT Techathon?</h2>
        <p>The INAT Techathon is a <strong>6-week virtual student competition</strong> that provides an opportunity to design and build a project in accordance with the values of Appropriate Technology. Teams will have several weeks to design a detailed solution or construct a prototype of an original project idea. This year’s theme is “Building Sustainable Rural and Urban Cities for Economic Growth, Enhancing Health and Eradicating Poverty”.</p>
