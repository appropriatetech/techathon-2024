          href="https://appropriatetech.net/">International Network on Appropriate
          Technology (INAT)</a> that will provide an opportunity to design and
          build a project in accordance with the values of Appropriate Technology.
          Student teams will have several weeks to design a detailed solution or
          construct a prototype.
